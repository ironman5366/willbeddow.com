title: Ursula
blurb: On the release of my open-source book app.
---

Today I'm releasing Ursula, an open-source app that lets you rank, curate, and share books.

- [Download Ursula on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ursula-books/id6478836951)
- Check out the source code at [github.com/ironman5366/ursula](https://github.com/ironman5366/ursula)
- Let me know if you want to be [notified when it's ready for Android / Google Play](https://forms.gle/rBYx6zG2y3juzfkcA)

Ursula features a stack-ranking mechanism (instead of stars) inspired by [Beli](https://beliapp.com/), some light
social features, and AI recommendations. It's named after Ursula Le Guin, and I'm indebted to
[Mash Ibtesum](https://mash.studio/) for his contributions to the app's design.
