Today I'm releasing Ursula, an open-source app that lets you rank, curate, and share books.

- Check out the source code at [github.com/ironman5366/ursula](https://github.com/ironman5366/ursula)
- Let me know if you want to be [notified when it's ready for Android / Google Play](https://forms.gle/rBYx6zG2y3juzfkcA)

I built Ursula over the last two months, in what's turned out to be a lovely little period of unemployment. In a few days
I move to San Francisco and start a new job, so it's time to write this post and release Ursula publicly, though I'm not
sure I'd ever feel that it was "ready".

Ursula features a stack-ranking mechanism (instead of stars), some light social features, and AI recommendations. It's named after Ursula Le Guin. I'm indebted to
[Mash Ibtesum](https://mash.studio/) for his contributions to the app's design. It's a non-commercial and
permissively-licensed project.

The initial idea from Ursula came from an app called [Beli](https://beliapp.com/). I loved that Beli forced you to
_stack-rank_ your favorite restaurants rather than assign them star ratings. I think these stack rankings are much
higher signal than stars - it doesn't mean much to me if a friend ranks a restaurant as 5 stars, but if I see that my
friend ranked a restaurant as #1 out of 424 restaurants they've been to, I'll go out of my way to try it.
