I‚Äôm in serious danger of breaking a very achievable resolution I set for 2024: to blog once a month. Since I‚Äôve already broken my other resolutions (avoid New Jersey, stop calling ChatGPT ‚Äúhomie‚Äù), it‚Äôs important to me to follow-through on this one.

I‚Äôve been wanting to get back into blogging for years. Putting my thoughts down on paper and hitting publish is a deeply clarifying process for me - something about publishing to an audience, even an imagined one, forces me to structure my thoughts.

The main barrier is my fear of writing poorly - in high school, I could confidently publish drivel week after week (see 16 year old me‚Äôs ‚ÄúHarry Potter Spells Are Like Websites‚Äù, or the smug Machine Learning blog I wrote while getting a C in Precalculus). Unfortunately, today, a crust of minimal self-awareness now provides friction to being a dumbass-at-large on Wordpress.

My goal is to once again shed that crust - if I want to make my writing less drivelsome, I‚Äôll only get there through forced practice and repetition.

In addition to writing practice, and clarity of thought, another benefit of blogging is the sense of accountability when I hit ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù. Is it rational to feel accountable to a crowd of crawler bots and the occasional salesperson trolling through LinkedIn? Maybe not, but the Baidu web spider has visited every one of my projects, and I‚Äôd hate to disappoint it.

The Building in Public movement has resonated with me for years on these grounds; I have a huge graveyard of 20% finished side projects, and if the parasociality of blogging about them can get me to actually finish one, it‚Äôd be a successful experiment. At this point, I‚Äôd even take getting to the 40% mark!

So, all of that being said, what do I want to work on this year?

# Ursula

Ursula (named for Ursula Le Guin) will be a a stack-ranking app for books, a la [https://beliapp.com/](https://beliapp.com/). I had this idea last year, when I started using Beli more. A stack rank, as opposed to stars, forces you to decide which is better between two options, and, at least on Beli, provides a much stronger signal than a star ranking.

A huge caveat here is that Beli is young, and hasn‚Äôt yet had to contend with the poisonous forces of monetization, which is probably a larger factor in driving down the rating quality of Yelp and Google than the star form factor. I think it‚Äôs cool, though, and I‚Äôd love to try it out with books.

I‚Äôd also like to integrate AI book recommendations with LLMs. Hopefully more on this soon!

## AI Engineering Musings and Weatherwax

I have big plans to be another asshole talking about OpenAI on the internet. But like, really.

Working on Waverly for the past few months has thrown me in the deep end with AI engineering. I don‚Äôt want to oversell my experience here - it‚Äôs just been about 4 months of working with LLMs full time. But \~500 hours in, while stochastic programming still feels just plain _strange_, I‚Äôm starting to form opinions and intuition about it.

I don‚Äôt have any particuraly ground-breaking insights here (evals are really important, and I agree with pretty much everything this blog post: [https://arvid.xyz/posts/prompt-design/](https://arvid.xyz/posts/prompt-design/)). I still want to talk about it, though!

I‚Äôve also come to dislike LangChain, and most other libraries that provide abstractions over the actual process of prompting the model yourself. It‚Äôs undeniable that you want some level of abstraction over any individual provider‚Äôs API, though - it‚Äôs crucial that any AI project be able to hot-swap models.

Everybody has their own solutions to this (and about half the class of any given YC batch is trying to build a new one), but after wrestling with it a few times in a few different projects, my preferred answer is an LLM proxy server that just abstracts the OpenAI API spec (which is becoming the de-facto standard among all providers) into a websocket server that you can use as a service.

I‚Äôd like to build a Rust implementation of this proxy server and publish it with clients in a number of languages. I‚Äôd also like to call it Weatherwax, after the character from Discworld.

I‚Äôll write more extensively about motivations for this when I get around to building it, but a large one is that I‚Äôve also come to believe that LLM integration should happen as close to the client as possible - I consider separating LLM calls into a service with a different API in your apps backend to be an antipattern.

## Revamp of This Website

(update 2/20/24: this is done! you're lookin' at it :) )

I‚Äôve been meaning to do this for _years_. I hacked together the current version of this website on a roadtrip freshman year of college, when I realized I was out of money and needed to start freelancing. It still uses jQuery (üôÅ), and I‚Äôm afraid to touch the server it runs on for fear I‚Äôll never get it back up.

I started remaking it in the summer of 2022 but two things went wrong:

- I got instantly distracted by every other possible task.
- My goals for it got impossibly large - not only was it going to have a custom built portal for my consulting, but I‚Äôd also build the CMS myself, and I‚Äôd make a little link shortener too. And ooh! Maybe I can also copy that cool file sharing tool that BCG has internally. And it has to look _sick._

This time I‚Äôll aim to keep myself to somewhat more modest goals. I want a flexible foundation that I can eventually add all these things to, but first I must make the foundation. And I should build it in something profoundly boring and reliable.

## Playground for AI experiments

I have a number of small one-off ideas I want to publish with LLMs.

For example, I think most chat-with-your-documentation implementations have fallen short for me because they try to chat with the full site. What I really want is a little chatbox under each page where I can ask follow-up questions. ‚ÄúHow do I use this with middleware?‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt working, what CORS settings can I mess with?‚Äù.

Other small things I might put here are a john henry ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry\_(folklore)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)>)) style game where you have to try and build a working web app faster than an LLM, some fun interactive creative writing exercises, and maybe some home grown evals (perhaps in the form of a snarky ‚Äúare we agentic yet‚Äù?)

This should be pretty easy to set up - I just need to revamp my site first!

## Do a Triathlon

This isn‚Äôt code related, but maybe writing it down will force me to actually find a good pool to train in in Brooklyn! The Gowanus Canal is starting to look mighty appealing with what pool access costs in this city.

# In Conclusion

Time will tell whether I follow-through on any of these things. If you‚Äôre a human who‚Äôs made it to end though, and any of these interest you, please get in touch about them! I‚Äôd love a collaborator, user, or just an interesting conversation on any of them. My email is [will@willbeddow.com](mailto:will@willbeddow.com).
