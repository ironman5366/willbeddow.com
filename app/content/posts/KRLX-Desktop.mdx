_Note from 2024: Same as [KRLX Mobile](/posts/KRLX-Mobile), this app is long-dead, keeping the post around for the vibes :)_

I'm happy to announce that you can now download and install a desktop app to play KRLX from your desktop.

- [Download Here](https://github.com/ironman5366/KRLXDesktop/releases)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/ironman5366/KRLXDesktop)

Installation Instructions:

- Mac
  - Download the .dmg file from the download
    link and install. If you get a warning saying that your computer won't
    allow you open apps from unidentified developers, open "Settings" ->
    "Security", check "Anywhere" under where to allow apps from.
- Windows
  - Download
    the .exe file from the download link and install. If you have Windows
    10, a box may pop up saying that smartscreen flagged the installation.
    Click "More Info" -> "Continue Anyway" (This happens because I'm a
    small developer and not a large publisher that Windows knows)
- Linux
  - Download and install the AppImage or Snap binary!

Features:

- Displays current show and information, pulling host info from Carleton directory
- Shows recently played songs, querying Spotify, and Youtube (Apple Music upcoming), for information
- Lists upcoming shows and information
- Allows users to chat with DJs from application

Click on the Spotify icon next to a song to open it in Spotify, and the Youtube one to open it in Youtube
