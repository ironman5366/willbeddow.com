### TL;DR

- Ursula is an open-source and non-commercial book-ranking app I'm working on. Kinda like Goodreads (but hopefully not too much like it).
- You can find the source-code at [github.com/ironman5366/ursula](https://github.com/ironman5366/ursula).
- I aim for there to be two distinguishing features:
  - **Stack-Ranking**, inspired by [Beli](https://beliapp.com/). Each book is definitively ranked in your list, rather than being given a star ranking. On Beli I find this is a much higher signal of how good a restaurant is - if a friend who eats out often ranks a restaurant in their top 10, I'm going to go!
  - **AI Recommendations**. I already frequently ask ChatGPT questions like "If I like sprawling sci-fi epics like "A Fire Upon the Deep", what should I read next?" This should be easy to build into Ursula.
    - Bonus points if I get my LLM proxy project Weatherwax involved in this. Read more in my last post.
- I'm giving myself a deadline: I want to have a public beta on the app store by **April 1, 2024**

### The long version

It's been \~a month since I wrote [my last post](/posts/2024-getting-back-to-blogging-and-building-in-public), so
if I want to keep my 2024 resolutions, it's time to write another.

It's been a wonderful month - I've had a lot of time, recently, post-Waverly, to work on projects and travel.
I'm writing this post from a hostel in the mountains, where I've been snowed in by [a blizzardÔ∏è](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/us/tahoe-blizzard-snow-forecast.html).
I'm fresh off of a week in San Francisco, where I was lucky to spend a lot of time talking to folks far smarter than me about AI, and get deep into diffusion models.
And, of course, I've been working on Ursula. (I also totally remade this website, but that's another post). Here are some (very) early unpolished screenshots of Ursula:

I'm really excited by Ursula; it has a well-defined and achievable goal ("binary search book rankings + ChatGPT recs") that many of my projects lack,
and it's been years since I've published a side project in the open and tried to start getting users for it.
The blogging, and giving myself the April 1st deadline, is really an outgrowth of this excitement - there's no technical or logistical reason that I shouldn't be able to get this app out before I'm gainfully employed again, and I want to
align my incentives to make sure I do.

### What's done so far:

- Basic app CRUD and setup on supabase
- Binary search
- Book search and google books integration
- Spend way too long browsing coolors.co for a color scheme

### What's left to do:
