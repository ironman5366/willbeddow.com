## TL;DR

- Ursula is an open-source book-ranking app I'm working on. Think Goodreads.
- Find the source-code at [github.com/ironman5366/ursula](https://github.com/ironman5366/ursula).
- I aim for there to be two distinguishing features:
  - **Stack-Ranking**, inspired by [Beli](https://beliapp.com/). Each book is definitively ranked in your list, rather than being given a star ranking. On Beli I find this is a much higher signal of how good a restaurant is - if a friend who eats out often ranks a restaurant in their top 10, I'm going to go!
  - **AI Recommendations**. I already frequently ask ChatGPT questions like "If I like sprawling sci-fi epics like "A Fire Upon the Deep", what should I read next?" This should be easy to build into Ursula.
    - Bonus points if I get my LLM proxy project Weatherwax involved in this. Read more in my last post.
- I'm giving myself a deadline: I want to have a public beta on the app store by **April 1, 2024**

It's been \~a month since I wrote [my last post](/posts/2024-getting-back-to-blogging-and-building-in-public), so
if I want to keep my 2024 resolutions, it's time to write another. It's been a wonderful month - I've had a lot of time,
recently, post-Waverly, to work on projects and travel.

I'm writing this post from a hostel in the mountains, where I've been snowed in by [a blizzardÔ∏è](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/us/tahoe-blizzard-snow-forecast.html).
I'm fresh off of a week in San Francisco, where I was lucky to spend a lot of time talking to folks far smarter than me about AI, and get deep into diffusion models.
And, of course, I've been working on Ursula.
