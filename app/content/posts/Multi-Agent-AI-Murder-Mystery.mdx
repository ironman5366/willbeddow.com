[Paul Scotti](https://paulscotti.github.io/ "Paul Scotti") polished and released a fun hackathon project we made together in march at a SynthLabs event - check it out at [https://ai-murder-mystery.onrender.com/](https://ai-murder-mystery.onrender.com/), and read his thread about the project at [https://x.com/humanscotti/status/1810777932568399933](https://x.com/humanscotti/status/1810777932568399933).

The premise is that each LLM in the mystery scenario has a secret in it's context window, but we use prompting and critiquing techniques to try and prevent them from revealing it.
