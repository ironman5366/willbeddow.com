As I've been working on [Ursula](/posts/Ursula-Development-Log-1 "Ursula") this month, I've been managing a large dataset of book metadata in postgres - it's a bit unwieldy, and often, when running some large operation, I want to run it in batches (so I can resume if it fails), and see the progress as it slowly executes. I created this procedure after a lot of pain this week: \


```pgsql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE proc_batched_update(table_name text, get_total_query text, update_query text) AS $$
DECLARE affected_rows INTEGER;
    DECLARE total_rows INTEGER;
    DECLARE progress INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Get the total number of rows to be updated
    EXECUTE get_total_query INTO total_rows;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Total rows to update on %: %', table_name, total_rows;

    progress := 0;

    LOOP
        EXECUTE update_query;

        GET DIAGNOSTICS affected_rows = ROW_COUNT;
        progress := progress + affected_rows;

        RAISE NOTICE 'Updated % rows in %, progress: %/%', affected_rows, table_name, progress, total_rows;

        COMMIT;

        EXIT WHEN affected_rows = 0;
    END LOOP;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Update completed. Total rows updated in %: %', table_name, progress;
END $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Here's an example of how you use it:\
\


```pgsql
CALL proc_batched_update(
  'ol_editions',
  'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ol_editions WHERE book_id IS NULL',
  'WITH cte AS (
                SELECT ol_editions.id, book_ol_id
                FROM ol_editions
                JOIN ol_books ON ol_books.ol_id = ol_editions.book_ol_id
                WHERE ol_editions.book_id IS NULL
                LIMIT 50000
)
            UPDATE ol_editions
            SET book_id = ol_books.id
            FROM cte
            JOIN ol_books ON ol_books.ol_id = book_ol_id
            WHERE ol_editions.id = cte.id; '
);
```

Note that the LIMIT in here is the batch size.\

Hope this is helpful to someone else!
