_note from 2024 as I migrate this post to my new blog: this app is long dead, but keeping the post up for the vibes :). I built this entire app sitting in a hammock in Carleton's arboretum. Good times._

## What is KRLX mobile?

KRLX mobile brings KRLX to your phone, enabling you to listen on the go, see information about your favorite shows and DJs, and add songs you like directly to the platforms you listen on, like Spotify and YouTube. Additionally, browse the show schedule for a term and the KRLX blog right from the app, while you're listening.

Also, **KRLX Mobile is fully open source, find the source code here**: github.com/ironman5366/KRLXMobile

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Apple music support?
  - Coming soon! _(note from 2024: 2019 me was lying lol)_
- The app says the stream is offline, but I know it's not. What's up with that?
  - Sometimes there are errors in the data that the stream sends out, and even though audio is sent, KRLX mobile can't read it. In most cases this is caused by a DJ logging a song that has a title with special characters that cause errors in the feed. If this is the case, the information will also be missing on live.krlx.org. If the information is there, but not in the app, it may be an error
- Why does KRLX Mobile need to know my location?
  - I use location data to determine if you're at Carleton, and if you are enable Carleton only features. No location data ever leaves your phone, and I never see or have access to any of it
- Where should I report errors?
  - Email me at [will@willbeddow.com](mailto:will@willbeddow.com), or open a Github issue!
- Is there a desktop version of this app?
  - Why yes there is! KRLX Desktop
